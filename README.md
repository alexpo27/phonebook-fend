# Phonebook Frontend

- My first shot at a full-stack project, just partially completed as of now. Frontend is done using **React**.

- User can add, remove and filter Persons from the phonebook.

- No styling was applied yet as my main focus was building the backend and getting used to **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS**.
